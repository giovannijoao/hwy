Notes about this setup:

1. It's using Tailwind and Vercel.
2. You need to set `NODEJS_HELPERS=0` in your production environment variables for Hono post requests to work on Vercel serverless.
3. We are git-ignoring `src/styles/tw-output.bundle.css` because that's what we are auto-generating with Tailwind. Normally, if you aren't using Tailwind, you would write your styles there directly and commit it. This also isn't necessarily the "right" way -- do whatever feels best to you.
4. It's using npm directly, to avoid interacting with pnpm at all, which is used for the overall monorepo.
